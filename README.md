## 🎯 About The Project

This is an advanced implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that challenges you to beat an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI uses the **MinMax Algorithm**, a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence, to calculate the optimal move at every turn.

Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe implementations with random or basic AI, this version provides a true challenge where the AI never makes a mistake. The best you can hope for is a draw!

### Why This Project?

This project serves multiple purposes:

- **Educational**: Demonstrates practical implementation of the MinMax algorithm
- **Interactive**: Provides a hands-on way to understand AI decision-making
- **Portfolio Piece**: Showcases modern web development practices with React, TypeScript, and advanced algorithms
- **Challenge**: Tests your strategic thinking against perfect play

## 🧠 The MinMax Algorithm

### What is MinMax?

The **MinMax Algorithm** is a recursive decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It's designed to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally.

### How It Works

The algorithm works by:

1. **Simulating All Possible Moves**: Starting from the current board state, it explores every possible future move recursively
2. **Evaluating End States**: When it reaches a terminal state (win, lose, or draw), it assigns a score:
   - **+10**: AI wins
   - **-10**: Human wins
   - **0**: Draw

3. **Maximizing/Minimizing**: 
   - **Maximizing Player (AI)**: Chooses the move with the highest score
   - **Minimizing Player (Human)**: Assumes the opponent will choose moves that minimize the AI's score

4. **Backtracking**: The algorithm backtracks through the game tree, propagating scores up to determine the best move at the current state

### Example Visualization

```
Current Board State
     |     |     
  X  |  O  |  X  
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
  O  |  X  |     
_____|_____|_____
     |     |     
     |     |  O  

AI evaluates all possible moves:
- Position 5: Leads to draw (score: 0)
- Position 7: Leads to win (score: +10) ✓ BEST MOVE
- Position 8: Leads to loss (score: -10)

AI chooses Position 7
```

### Key Characteristics

- **Complete**: Explores all possible game states
- **Optimal**: Always finds the best move
- **Deterministic**: Given the same board state, always chooses the same move
- **Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth

### Real-World Applications

The MinMax algorithm is used in:
- Chess engines
- Checkers and board games
- Two-player zero-sum games
- Decision-making systems
- Game AI development
